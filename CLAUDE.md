# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a new project (super-one) that is being initialized. The .gitignore is configured for Node.js/JavaScript development with support for various frameworks (Next.js, Nuxt.js, Vue, Svelte, Vite).

## Getting Started

As this is a new repository, the project structure and commands will be established as development progresses. Update this file with:

- Build commands (`npm run build`, `yarn build`, etc.)
- Test commands (`npm test`, how to run a single test)
- Lint commands (`npm run lint`)
- Development server commands
- Any project-specific architectural decisions
